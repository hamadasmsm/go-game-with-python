# Agent_for-Go
An AI agent for the game of GO using minimax algorithm

In this code, you can run my_player.py to run the code and play with my agent in a terminal. 
Automatically, human player is white in the first game and black in the second game.
Hyperparameters of the heuristic function have been tuned against random, greedy and aggresive GO agents, defeating them all.
